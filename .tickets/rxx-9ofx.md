# Milestone 1: Basic UDP Hole Punching

Establish bidirectional UDP communication between two peers behind firewalls

## Acceptance Criteria

CLI parses send/receive modes with IPv6 addresses; Both peers send probe packets every second; Bidirectional UDP channel detected; Probing stops after successful communication; Timeout after 10s with 3 retries; Clear connection status logging


## Notes

**2026-02-13T22:50:56Z**

Milestone 1 completed! All tasks finished: project setup, CLI parsing, UDP socket/probing, bidirectional detection, and timeout/retry mechanism. UDP hole punching is fully functional.
